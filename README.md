# text-to-mysql

The code sets up an LLAMA model and a MySQL database, then uses these components to create a chain of tools that can be used to interact with the database and answer user questions. The code defines several chains and tools, including a SQL query chain that can generate SQL queries from user questions, and a toolkit that provides various tools for interacting with the database. Finally, the code creates an agent executor that uses these tools to respond to user input and stream the responses back to the user.
